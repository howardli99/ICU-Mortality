# ICU-Mortality
This is a project made by YunHao Li, Harry Lawson and Daniel Clark.

This is a web application used to predict mortality of patients in ICU units and hence, the hospital can analyse their performance.

The complete user guide is included in 'User Guides.pdf'. Please read it first before using the web application.
